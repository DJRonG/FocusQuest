# FocusQuest Static Site Update

## IMPORTANT: Files to DELETE from your GitHub repo

Before uploading these files, **DELETE these files** from your GitHub repo:
- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json` 
- `vite.config.ts` (or `vite_config.ts`)
- `App.tsx`
- `index.tsx`
- `types.ts`
- `metadata.json`

These files tell Vercel to run a React build, which causes the black screen.

## Files to UPLOAD/REPLACE

1. **index.html** - Replace your current index.html with this one
2. **vercel.json** - Replace your current vercel.json with this one

## Keep your existing files

Keep these files in your repo:
- dashboard.html
- dashboard.css
- dashboard.js
- qr-manager.html
- qr-manager.css
- qr-manager.js
- style.css
- script.js
- README.md
- .gitignore
- backend/ folder
- docs/ folder

## After uploading

1. Commit and push to GitHub
2. Vercel will auto-redeploy
3. Your site should show the landing page with links to Dashboard and QR Manager
