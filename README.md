## ✨ Features

- **🧠 AI-Powered Task Management**: Chat with the FocusQuest agent to add, update, delete, and find tasks using natural language.
- **📈 AI Priority Suggestions**: Get smart prioritization advice. Gemini analyzes deadlines, task dependencies, and long-term Quests to suggest whether a task should be High, Medium, or Low priority.
- **💡 Task Completion Insights**: Receive actionable, positive feedback immediately after finishing a task to help you refine your process and mindset for the future.
- **🌱 Growth Hub**: A dedicated space for lifelong learning.
    - **📝 Notes**: Quick-capture thoughts and quotes throughout the day.
    - **💡 Video/Topic Insights**: Enter any topic (e.g., "Stoicism" or "Rust programming") to get three actionable "growth points" generated by AI.
- **🧘 Mindful Transitions**: A calming transition screen appears between tasks, providing AI-generated mindfulness prompts and context-aware scenes (like "Deep Focus" or "Winding Down") to help you reset.
- **📋 Kanban-Style Workflow**: Organize tasks in a clear `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done` workflow with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **🔗 Task Dependencies**: Create relationships between tasks to ensure they're completed in the right order.
- **⏰ Pomodoro Focus Timer**: Start a focus session to block out distractions, with a built-in feedback loop to track your productivity.
- **🌐 Research Agent**: Ask the agent to research topics on the web. It uses Google Search grounding to provide up-to-date answers with sources.
- **📄 URL Summarizer**: Paste any URL and have the Web Scraper Agent provide a concise summary.
- **🧩 Task Breakdown**: Decompose large, complex tasks into smaller, actionable sub-tasks with a single click.
- **📅 Calendar Integration**: Connect your Google or Outlook calendar to view today's events and schedule tasks directly from the app.
- **✨ Daily Inspiration**: Get a motivational quote every day, generated by AI based on your interests and YouTube history.
- **🏠 Workspace Simulation**: Control virtual "Focus Lighting" and "Ambient Sound" (Rain, Cafe, Deep Focus, Forest) to create your perfect work environment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
